feature -- Access

	feature_: AUT_FEATURE_OF_TYPE
			-- Feature for which the linear constraint is solved

	linear_solvable_predicates: DS_LINKED_LIST [AUT_PREDICATE_ACCESS_PATTERN]
			-- Linear solvable predicates associated with their access patterns

	context_queries: HASH_TABLE [STRING, STRING]
			-- Table of contraining queries and their values
			-- [Query value, query name]
			-- For example, in precondition "0 < i and then i < count",
			-- query "count" is a context query'.

	last_solution: DS_HASH_TABLE [INTEGER, INTEGER]
			-- Table of last linearly sovled operands
			-- [operand value, operand index]
			-- Operand index is 0-based, but in here the operand is already larger than 0,
			-- because linear constraint solving for target operand is not supported.
			-- Only has effect if `has_last_solution' is True

feature -- Status report

	has_last_solution: BOOLEAN
			-- Does last call to `solve' generated a solution?

	is_input_format_correct: BOOLEAN
			-- Is the last generated linear solver of the correct format?

feature -- Basic operations

	solve is
			-- Try to solve constraints defined in `linear_solvable_predicates' and `context_queries'.
			-- If there is a solution, set `has_last_solution' to True and put that solution into
			-- `last_solution'. Otherwise, set `has_last_solution' to False.
		deferred
		end

feature{NONE} -- Implementation

	linear_solvable_operands: DS_HASH_SET [STRING]
			-- Names of linearly solvable arguments

	set_last_solution (a_valuation: HASH_TABLE [INTEGER, STRING]) is
			-- Set `last_solution' with `a_valuation'.
