========================

AUTHORS:

  * Hannes Roth <haroth@student.ethz.ch>

  * Yi Wei <yi.wei@inf.ethz.ch>

DESCRIPTION:

  * MySQL C API wrapper for Eiffel
    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/c.html

  * Contains both C and Eiffel code

IMPORTANT:

  * The Clib folder contains a dummy implementation
    without any functionality to allow compilation of
    Eve for users without MySQL. Please follow the
    steps outlined below to install a working copy.

REQUIREMENTS:

  * MySQL Header Files
      Unix/Linux: Usually available as a package, eg. libmysqlclient10-dev
      Mac OS X/Windows: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/

  * EiffelStudio 6.8

INSTALLATION UNIX/LINUX/MAC OS X:

  * Ensure that you have
    the MySQL header files in /usr/include/mysql
    and the MySQL library files in /usr/lib

  * Ensure that this library's folder is in
    %ISE_LIBRARY%/library

  * In %EIFFEL_SRC%/library/mysql/Clib_Full,
    run "finish_freezing -library"

  * You might need to use "sudo finish_freezing -library"

INSTALLATION WINDOWS:

  * Ensure that "MySQL Connector" is installed in
    %EIFFEL_SRC%\library\mysql\Clib_Full\connector-win

  * Ensure that this library's folder is in
    %ISE_LIBRARY%/library

  * In %EIFFEL_SRC%\library\mysql\Clib_Full, run "compile_library.bat"

NOTES:

  * After you run "compile_library.bat or "finish_freezing -library",
    the mysql.ecf file in %EIFFEL_SRC%\library\mysql will be replaced
    with a new one. Please do not commit that file.

USAGE:

  * Please look at example/mysql_examples.e
