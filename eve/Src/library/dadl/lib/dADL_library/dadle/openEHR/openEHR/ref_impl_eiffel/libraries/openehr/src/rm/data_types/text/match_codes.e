			  Codes for mapping of a term to a text item:
			  The relative match of the target term with respect to the mapped text item. 
			 	‘>’: the mapping is to a broader term
			 			e.g. orginal text = “arbovirus infection”, target = “viral infection”
			 	‘=’: the mapping is to a (supposedly) equivalent to the original item
			 	‘<’: the mapping is to a narrower term. e.g. original text = “diabetes”, mapping
			 			= “diabetes mellitus”.
			 	‘?’: the kind of mapping is unknown. 
			   The first three values are taken from the ISO standards 2788 (“Guide to Establishment
			   and development of monolingual thesauri”) and 5964 (“Guide to Establishment
			   and development of multilingual thesauri”).
