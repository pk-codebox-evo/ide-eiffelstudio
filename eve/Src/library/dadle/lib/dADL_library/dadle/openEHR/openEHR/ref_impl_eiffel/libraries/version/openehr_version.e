			-- The Subversion revision number: automatically set by the SConstruct.
			-- Make sure this is zero whenever the class is committed to Subversion.
			-- Builds done within EiffelStudio will therefore always show revision 0.
			-- This helps distinguish a developer build from a proper release build.
			-- A proper release build done by the SConstruct will have a non-zero revision number.
			-- The SConstruct automatically reverts its change, after it has finished building.
