	proof: DV_ENCAPSULATED	
			-- Proof of attestation.
			
	attested_view: DV_MULTIMEDIA
			-- Optional visual representation of content attested e.g. screen image.

	items: SET [DV_EHR_URI]
			-- Items attested. Although not recommended, these may include fine-grained 
			-- items which have been attested in some other system. Otherwise the attestation 
			-- is for the entire Version with which it is associated.

			-- reason of attestation; coded by openEHR terminology group
			-- "attestation reason"

	is_pending: BOOLEAN
			-- True if this attestation is pending
