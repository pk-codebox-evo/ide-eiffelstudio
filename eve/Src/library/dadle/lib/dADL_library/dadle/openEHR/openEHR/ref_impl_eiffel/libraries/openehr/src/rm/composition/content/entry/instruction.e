	description: "[
	              A model of future actions, characterised by time specifications (rather than actual
	              times of occurrence, as found in observations). As time progresses, the lifecycle
	              of an instruction progresses through various states, according to a state machine
	              definition 
			  	- an instruction represents an intent that some acts relating to the subject of care 
			  	  should occur such as taking a medication, having therapy or surgery
				- instructions may result in orders being placed to a filler; an order explicitly
				  requests the resources needed for the instruction to be obtained and made available 
				  for the patient. For example, a prescription is a simple order created from 
				  medication order instructions
				- orders are also modelled using instructions
				 Concrete type representing 'scientific' quantities, i.e. quantities expressed 
				 as a single value and a single, optional units.
