	description: "[
			     Abstract class providing convertibility from a DT structure to any object type.
			     
			     The `make_dt' routine provides a parameterless make routine that can be safely called by DT_OBJECT_CONVERTER during 
			     deserialisation, to ensure invariants are satisfied directly after initial creation.
			     
			     The `persistent_attributes' attribute defines a list of names of attributes that should be persisted, since often 
			     there are other extraneous attributes. If empty, the DT_OBJECT_CONVERTER
			     routines will assume all.
