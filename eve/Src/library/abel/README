Note: ABEL has moved to the EiffelStudio unstable branch:

https://svn.eiffel.com/eiffelstudio/trunk/Src/unstable/library/persistency/abel

All libraries and test suites here are either outdated 
or there is a better library solving the same task 
within the eth branch or EiffelStudio itself. 
This whole directory can be safely removed in the future.

If you have any questions regarding its contents,
please ask either Roman Schmocker (romans@eiffel.com) or
Marco Piccioni (marco.piccioni@inf.ethz.ch)
