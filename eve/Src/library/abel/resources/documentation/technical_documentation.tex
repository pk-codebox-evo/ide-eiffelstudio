\section{Limitations of the library}
TODO

Current limitations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Not all features available if adapted to a custom DB layout 
\item Inheritance currently not properly supported (due to limitation of INTERNAL)
\item Reals have rounding error
\item No ordering support (at least not yet)
\item
\end{itemize}

%What exactly has to be here? Is a missing feature (like ordering support) a limitation as well?

%\subsection{Moved to technical documentation}
%about criteria
%It will internally build a tree of criteria, with specialized AND, OR or NOT instances as nodes and the usual predefined or agent instances as leafs.


%\subsubsection{Performance remarks}

%ABEL will try to let the backend do as much of the filtering as is possible, to reduce the overhead of e.g. network communication or building unnecessary objects.
%This especially means that ABEL will compile predefined queries to SQL if you have a relational database as a backend. 
%However, if there is an agent criterion OR-ed to a predefined criterion, the test can not be made in the database because you might get false negatives.
%Therefore, to have optimal performance, you should consider the following points:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Try not to use agent criteria if you have a relational database backend.
%\item Try not to use OR on agent criteria.
%\item Try to keep OR-ed agent criteria as deep down the tree as possible (as the above OR-node defaults to true and thus is not checked for in the backend)
%\end{itemize}
