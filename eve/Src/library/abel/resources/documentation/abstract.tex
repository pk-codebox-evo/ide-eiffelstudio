\section*{Abstract}

ABEL is an approach to wrap every existing persistence library under a simple and yet powerful API.
The programming interface of ABEL is completely transparent to the actual storage mechanism, and it supports the CRUD operations, transactions, and some advanced features like result filtering based on some criteria.

ABEL has a flexible framework that allows to adapt the API to basically any existing persistence solution.
The framework has a reusable object-relational mapper at its core and is open for extensions and customization.
