\section*{Abstract}

ABEL is a persistence library that unifies existing solutions under a simple and transparent API.
The API fully supports the CRUD operations, transactions, and has some advanced features like result filtering based on some criteria.

The library contains a powerful framework with an object-relational mapping layer at the core that allows to adapt ABEL to basically any existing persistence solution.
