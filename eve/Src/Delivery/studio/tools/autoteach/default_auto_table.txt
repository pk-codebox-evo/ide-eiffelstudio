# Default table used in automatic mode, that is, when the users trusts AutoTeach
# to do the job. Implements a (hopefully) reasonable default, general-purpose policy,
# revealing the code gradually. The user can still override whatever he wishes with annotations.
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
# This file should only be edited by a developer who is modifying AutoTeach and wants to
# change its default policies. Users of AutoTeach willing to use a different policy from
# AutoTeach's default should load a custom table instead of modifying this file.
