# Default table used in manual mode. Manual mode means that everything
# is handled manually by the user through annotations.
# This table shows the bare skeleton of features (including arguments) and hides all the rest,
# giving total freedom to the user to do what he wants with manual annotations (and possibly textual hints).
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
# This file should only be edited by a developer who is modifying AutoTeach and wants to
# change its default policies. Users of AutoTeach willing to use a different policy from
# AutoTeach's default should load a custom table instead of modifying this file.

# ------------------------- Complex blocks -------------------------

# Hint level:							0

# Always show features...
 			feature 					T
# ...but always hide their content...
content 	feature 					F

# ...with the exception of arguments:
			arguments					T
content		arguments					T			

# The following complex blocks should be visible, but without their content:
			precondition				T
			locals						T
			routine_body				T
			postcondition				T
			class_invariant				T

# If, inspect and loop blocks are hidden, but their inner complex blocks
# (e.g. branches) must be shown if the parent blocks are shown:
			if							F
			if_branch					T

			inspect						F
			inspect_branch				T
			
			loop						F
			loop_initialization			T
			loop_invariant				T
			loop_termination			T
#			See below for loop_termination_expression
			loop_body					T
			loop_variant				T
#			See below for loop_variant_expression


# ------------------------- Atomic blocks -------------------------
# The visibility of atomic blocks should in general not be fixed.
# Instead, it should be determined by the content visibility of
# the location where they appear.

# Hint level:							0
