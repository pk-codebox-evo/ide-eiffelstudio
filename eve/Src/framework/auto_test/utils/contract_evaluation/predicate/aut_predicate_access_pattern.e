	description: "[
			Predicate access pattern from a feature.
			This classes maintains a two way mapping from
			entities of a feature (target, argument) to arguments
			of a predicate.
			
			For example:
			
			l.put (v: ANY; i: INTEGER)
				require
					extendible: l.extendible
					not_has_v: not has (v)
					
			The predicate "extendible" is a one argument predicate, the first
			argument of the predicate is the target object.
			
			The predicate "not_has_v" is a two argument predicate, the first
			argument of the predicate is the target object, and then second 
			argument of the predicate is the first argument of the feature call.
