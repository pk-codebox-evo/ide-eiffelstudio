I would like to thank my supervisor Bernd Schoeller for his competent support and helpful advices. He always had time for answering my questions and giving hints concerning implementation and general library design. I also would like to thank the other members of the \emph{ballet} team (Raphael Mack and Jason (Yi) Wei).

Additionally I would like to thank my girlfriend, my family and my friends for the support during my studies and this thesis.
