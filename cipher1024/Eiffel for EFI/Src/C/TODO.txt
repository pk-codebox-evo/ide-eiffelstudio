Those are the remaining tasks to make sure the runtime compiles correctly for EFI

- Select the Unix console instead of windows' (or, alternatively, implement one to run on EFI)
- Disable the compilation of the multithreading code
- Make sure the single file programs are linked with the right libraries
- Change the compilation of executables, in general, so that it may generate general efi binary files (through the postprocessing of dll files)
